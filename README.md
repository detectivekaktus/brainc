# brainc
***THIS PROJECT IS IN AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH!***

Brainc is a toolset that allows you to execute brainfuck code efficiently due to its implementation written in pure C. For compilation, the toolset offers to its user only the x86-64 processor architechture; the files compiled are in *ELF64* format.

## Compilation
It's used *GNU Make* tool and any C compiler (either gcc or clang) to compile the source code. You would also need NASM assembler. You can execute the following instruction in your terminal:
```console
make
```

You will find yourself with a new directory called `build` in the project's root folder in which you find the executable `brainc` which is the compiler itself.

## Usage
The toolset has the following flags:
| Flag     | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `-h` `--help` | Outputs help information about the compiler |
| `-v` `--version` | Outputs version of the compiler |
| `-i` `--interpret` | Interprets the source `.bf` file |
| `-c` `--compile` | Compiles the source `.bf` file down to ELF64 executable |
| `-o` `--output` | Used with `-c` or `-S` flags. Compiles the source `.bf` file down to ELF64 executable with a specified name |
| `-S` | Outputs assembly generated by the compiler |

## Examples
You can find examples in the `examples` directory and execute them with the toolset.
